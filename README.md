# Current/Emerging Trends in CS

## • Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
For this project I implemented a Deep Q-Learning solution in order solve a maze. Much of the code surrounding the building of the maze, defining the agent and its actions, defining episodes, and the neural network was provided to us. It was my task to implement the way all of these different object/functions would be called, recorded, used, etc. in order to get an agent to be able to move through the maze and eventually "solve" the maze.
## • Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

- ### What do computer scientists do and why does it matter? <br>
  Computer scientists work to solve real world problems using computers, algorithms, data science, and/or robotics. This matters because it facilitates the advancement of humans by creating novel methods for solving problems or makes known/current methods more efficient. The ability of humans to think critically and solve problems is what sets us apart from other animals and is the what has led to extraordinary feats such as space travel, genome editing, and harnessing nuclear energy.

- ### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist? <br>
  I approach problems similar to a computer scientist in that I research a problem, look for potential solutions, research the solutions, and then work on a method to implement one or more of the solutions to solve said problem. Computer scientists must be able to research both the problem and potential solutions thoroughly in order to get the whole picture surrounding both. I also do this so that I fully understand the problem and don't spend time trying to implement solutions that would end up not solving the problem.

- ### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization? <br>
    My ethical responsibilities to the user are to ensure that the product/project that I work on meets the user's needs in a manner that does not perpetuate things such as racism and stereotypes. I also have a responsibility to use/store user data responsibly and ethically. My ethical responsibilities to an organization are to guide them in the use of data, algorithms, computer systems, etc. in a manner that is publicly and privately acceptable while also bringing attention to any behavior contrary to these practices.
